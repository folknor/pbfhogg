# pbfhogg TODO.

## Important: ignored tests

`roundtrip_denmark` in `tests/roundtrip_real.rs` is `#[ignore]` — it roundtrips the entire
Denmark PBF (~54s) and is too slow for the normal edit-test cycle. **Must be run before any
release and after completing major work** (especially changes to reader, writer, block_builder,
or BlockBuilder/PbfWriter APIs):

    brokkr check -- --ignored

`sorted_flag_but_unsorted_nodes_panics` in `tests/read_paths.rs` is `#[ignore]` — it
verifies the debug monotonicity assertion fires on unsorted nodes when `Sort.Type_then_ID`
is declared. Requires `debug_assertions` to be enabled in the test profile. Nightly 1.95
(2026-02-25) has a regression where `debug_assertions` is off in test builds.

## Memory work — instrumentation prerequisites

Instrumentation code is implemented. Remaining: brokkr schema v3
(`SCHEMA_REDESIGN.md`) for `peak_rss_mb` as a first-class DB column and
subprocess kv pairs flowing into `run_kv` instead of JSON.

### Emit peak RSS from bench-merge — DONE
- [x] `read_peak_rss_kb()` in `cli/src/main.rs` (Linux: VmHWM, non-Linux: None)
- [x] Emits `peak_rss_kb=NNN` to stderr after merge

### Blob-size and byte-level rewrite stats — DONE
- [x] `bytes_passthrough`, `bytes_rewritten`, `blob_sizes` in `MergeStats`
- [x] Phase 4 tracking: passthrough frame sizes + rewrite block sizes
- [x] `print_summary()` emits byte rewrite ratio and p50/p95/p99 blob sizes

### DiffOverlay heap size estimate — DONE
- [x] `DiffOverlay::heap_size_estimate(&self) -> usize` in `src/osc.rs`
- [x] `diff_heap_bytes` field in `MergeStats`, set after `parse_osc_file()`
- [x] Emitted in `print_summary()` and `run_bench_merge()` kv output

### Per-phase RSS sampling — DONE (hotpath-gated)
- [x] `read_rss_kb()` reads `/proc/self/statm` resident pages
- [x] `PhaseRss` struct: rolling max at classify/rewrite/output boundaries + after flush
- [x] 5 kv pairs: `phase_rss_{after_osc,classify_max,rewrite_max,output_max,after_flush}_kb`

### Per-phase wall time accumulation — DONE (hotpath-gated)
- [x] `PhaseTimers` struct: osc_parse, classify_total, rewrite_total, output_total, trailing_creates
- [x] 5 kv pairs: `{osc_parse,classify_total,rewrite_total,output_total,trailing_creates}_ms`

## Performance: parallelism

- [ ] `pipeline.rs:14-18` — `READ_AHEAD=16` / `DECODE_AHEAD=32` are hardcoded.
  `READ_AHEAD` bounds the `sync_channel` between the I/O thread (Stage 1) and
  the rayon decode pool (Stage 2) — the I/O thread blocks when 16 compressed
  blobs are buffered. `DECODE_AHEAD` bounds the channel between the decode pool
  and the main-thread reorder buffer (Stage 3) — decode threads block when 32
  decoded blocks are pending. `DECODE_AHEAD` is 2× `READ_AHEAD` because decode
  results arrive out-of-order and the reorder `VecDeque` needs headroom to
  reconstruct file order without stalling Stage 1.

  Backpressure is automatic via bounded `sync_channel`: if the main thread's
  `block_fn` is slow, the decode channel fills → decode threads block on send →
  raw channel fills → I/O thread blocks on send. No manual tuning needed.

  Memory cost: ~16 × 32KB (compressed) + 32 × 1.4MB (decoded) ≈ **51 MB** peak
  pipeline overhead, independent of file size. The `DecompressPool` recycles
  decode buffers so cumulative alloc is near-zero (vs 10.2 GB naive for Denmark,
  ~1.7 TB for planet).

  Making these configurable would require a pipeline config struct on the public
  `for_each_pipelined` API. Hotpath profiling (Denmark through Japan) shows the
  pipeline is balanced at all tested scales — I/O thread doesn't stall, rayon
  workers are barely loaded, main thread is the bottleneck. **Low priority** —
  configure when someone reports a problem on a memory-constrained system.

- [ ] **Rayon alternatives for slice-based parallelism** — Wild linker discussion
  ([davidlattimore/wild#1072](https://github.com/davidlattimore/wild/discussions/1072)) surveys
  the landscape. Key options:
  - **paralight** (v0.0.8) — lightweight, targets slice/mut-slice parallelism. Can run on top of
    rayon's thread pool via `RayonThreadPool::new_global` (no extra threads). Has proper
    `try_for_each_init` that inits once per thread (rayon inits once per work item). Only needs
    `&` not `&mut` for the rayon backend. Limitation: no scopes, no graph algorithms, no recursive
    parallelism. Max `u32::MAX` elements.
  - **orx-parallel** — has `using()` API for guaranteed per-thread init. No thread pool yet
    (spawns threads per pipeline), on roadmap. No scopes/graph support.
  - **chili** — low-level, only provides `join`. A rayon fork (`par-iter`) builds par_iter on top
    of it. Uses lazy scheduling (less overhead for fine-grained work).
  - **forte** — experimental, rayon-like API with lazy scheduling. Supports spawn, join, scopes,
    scoped spawns. No par_iter or par_bridge yet.
  - **spindle** — built on rayon, optimised for small tasks. Very early.

  Wild's `thread_local` crate trick is also relevant: wrap per-thread state in
  `thread_local::ThreadLocal` and `.get_or()` inside rayon closures to guarantee one init per
  thread. Simple and works today without switching libraries.

  **Current rayon usage (3 sites, all working well):**

  | Site | Pattern | Pool | Purpose |
  |------|---------|------|---------|
  | `pipeline.rs:85-104` | `ThreadPoolBuilder` + `spawn` | Dedicated | Decode pool (Stage 2) |
  | `writer.rs:289` | `rayon::spawn()` | Global | Parallel compression |
  | `merge.rs` | `par_iter().map_init()` | Global | Batch classify + parallel rewrite |
  | `reader.rs:350` | `into_par_iter().try_fold().try_reduce()` | Global | `par_map_reduce` |

  The pipeline decode pool uses a dedicated `ThreadPoolBuilder` with `available_parallelism() - 2`
  threads (reserving 2 for I/O + consumer) and raw `rayon::spawn` — it doesn't use par_iter at
  all. The writer uses global-pool `rayon::spawn` for parallel compression. `par_map_reduce` batch-
  collects all blobs then uses lock-free `into_par_iter` (replaced an earlier `par_bridge` +
  Mutex approach that had contention at 8+ cores). Merge uses `par_iter().map_init(Vec::new, ...)`
  for per-thread decompression buffer reuse during classify.

  The `thread_local::ThreadLocal` trick could replace merge's `map_init(Vec::new, ...)`, but the
  practical gain is zero — `Vec::new()` is stack-only (no heap allocation until first push), so
  rayon re-initing it under work-stealing costs nothing. Switching to paralight would add a
  dependency for marginal benefit on a path that already works well. **Low priority** — revisit
  only if rayon becomes a proven bottleneck (e.g. if parallel `rewrite_block` exposes contention
  in the global pool).

## Performance: regressions from indexdata/tagdata

Measured at commit `23862d1` with `zlib-ng`, Denmark indexed PBF (487 MB).
Old baselines: read at `90df51f` (461 MB non-indexed), write at `def80d9`.

- [ ] **Parallel read: 0.31s → 0.45s (+45%).** `par_map_reduce` regression.
  Larger blob headers (42-byte indexdata + variable tagdata) are parsed across
  all cores. The per-blob overhead is small but multiplied by rayon parallelism
  it adds up. Investigate whether the wire parser skips unknown BlobHeader fields
  efficiently or does unnecessary work.

- [ ] **Write floor: 6.2s → 7.1s pipelined, 7.8s sync (+15-26%).** The
  decode+encode floor moved up because BlockBuilder now computes tagdata
  (per-block tag key set) and bbox (decimicrodegree min/max) for BlobIndex v2.
  Also reading from the larger indexed PBF adds ~1s decode overhead. Profile
  tagdata collection and bbox tracking to find low-hanging fruit.

- [ ] **Write sync zlib:6: 14.5s → 16.4s (+13%).** Follows from the higher
  floor — compression time itself is unchanged but the encode path is slower.

- [ ] **Write sync zstd:3: 8.1s → 9.9s (+22%).** Same root cause as above.

## Performance: CLI commands vs osmium

All CLI commands now beat osmium except extract --simple.

- [ ] **Extract simple: remaining gap vs osmium.** Simple is 1.47x slower on
  Denmark, 1.70x on Japan. The gap is structural: 2 passes vs osmium's 1.
  The extra file read costs ~1.3s on Denmark, ~5s on Japan. Full analysis
  in `notes/extract-parallel-collection.md`.
  - [ ] **Single-pass simple with parallel inline writing.** Stream through
    the pipelined reader, collect + filter matching elements per block, batch
    matched blocks for parallel writing via rayon. Eliminates the second file
    read. Challenge: the collection consumer (which is sequential) and the
    write dispatch (which needs rayon) must coexist in the same pass.

- [ ] **`add-locations-to-ways` Pass 1 (hash index building).** Already faster
  than osmium on Denmark (11.4s vs 12.0s), but Pass 1 (FxHashMap node index
  build) is sequential and the bottleneck at larger scales. Options:
  - Parallel hash map build: partition nodes by ID range across threads, each
    builds a sub-map, then merge. Or use a concurrent map (dashmap/flurry).
  - The Dense mmap index variant avoids this entirely (direct indexing, no
    hash table) but requires `vm.overcommit_memory=1` for planet-scale capacity.

## Performance: Linux kernel features for planet-scale I/O

Research notes: `notes/linux-async-io.md`.

Target deployment: nidhogg weekly planet merge on Linux 6.18, planet PBF on erofs.
Nidhogg will use erofs (atomic swap of entire planet data at runtime), so
`Compression::None` PBFs on erofs is the baseline assumption for the optimized path.

- [ ] **Large folios for mmap reads.** On 6.14+, file-backed mmap gets transparent
  2MB huge pages automatically. Low priority — mmap is not the production hot path
  and is already the slowest read mode. Only relevant at planet scale (80GB, 20M
  TLB entries). If implemented, should be opt-in to avoid regressing small files.

## Before crates.io publish

- [ ] Add LICENSE-APACHE copyright header (currently has upstream b-r-u only)
- [ ] Verify edition 2024 is intentional — most published crates use 2021 for broader compatibility
- [ ] Fix crate-level doc example: says `pbfhogg = "0.1"` but Cargo.toml is 0.2.0
- [ ] Add doc comments to `writer.rs` public API (PbfWriter, Compression)
- [ ] Add doc comments to `block_builder.rs` public API (BlockBuilder, Metadata, MemberData)
- [ ] Add crate-level documentation for write/merge workflows (lib.rs)
- [ ] Tighten module visibility: `pub mod commands`, `pub mod osc`, `pub use
  read::file_reader`, `pub use write::file_writer` expose internals as public API
- [ ] Fix `error.rs:27` doc: says "when reading PBF files" but errors occur during writing too
- [ ] Publish to crates.io

## GitHub

- [ ] Write GitHub repo description and tags (openstreetmap, pbf, protobuf, osm, rust)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI — clippy, tests, rustfmt, doc build on Linux
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions release pipeline — build binaries on tag push, attach to GitHub release
- [ ] Add a CHANGELOG.md before first tagged release

## Website

- [ ] Write a small 1-page project website (what it does, benchmarks, usage, link to repo)
- [ ] Host via GitHub Pages

## Refactoring: duplicated metadata extraction

`dense_node_metadata()`, `element_metadata()`, `dense_node_raw_metadata()`,
`element_raw_metadata()`, `flush_block()`, and `rebuild_header()` are shared
helpers in `commands/mod.rs`.

sort.rs still has its own inline metadata extraction (uses `OwnedMetadata`
with owned `String` instead of borrowed `Metadata<'a>`).

## Code TODOs

- [ ] **Possible correctness issue in OSC parsing:** In create/modify node
  parsing, missing lat/lon currently falls back to 0.0 instead of erroring.
  Ref: `src/osc.rs:261`, `src/osc.rs:262`. Malformed diffs could silently
  produce wrong geometry at (0,0).

- [ ] **Merge function complexity hotspot:** The merge flow is very large and
  highly stateful. Ref: `src/commands/merge.rs:943`. Good candidate for
  maintainability hardening (fewer latent bugs during future changes).

- [ ] `src/indexed.rs:42` — `relation_ids` field in `IdRanges` is populated but
  unused. `IndexedReader` only has `read_ways_and_deps` (2-pass: filter ways →
  fetch dependent nodes) and `for_each_node`. A `read_relations_and_deps` would
  need 3+ passes: pass 1 filter relations → collect member way/node/relation IDs;
  pass 2 fetch member ways → collect their node refs; pass 3 fetch all dependent
  nodes. Recursive relation members (relations containing relations) add another
  pass or fixpoint loop. The `relations_available()` method is already written
  but commented out (line 80-89). The field and method are zero-cost as-is —
  park until a concrete consumer exists (e.g. extract --smart, or a library user
  doing relation-based filtering).

## Benchmarking

- [ ] Track peak RSS during reads and merges at scale. Denmark for CI, planet for release validation.
- [ ] Run Germany full profiling suite (4.5 GB, ~500M elements). Currently only
  merge timing exists — missing read baselines (tags-count, check-refs),
  decode+write (cat --type), and allocations. Run:
  `brokkr profile --dataset germany`
  Then update `notes/region-profiles.md` with the results.

## Nice to have

- [ ] Consider adding `serde` feature for element serialization
